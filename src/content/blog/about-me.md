Hello, my name is fuxingZhang, and starting from 2025, I will be embarking on an exciting journey as a full-time independent developer with a primary focus on iOS app development. My passion for technology and software engineering has led me to dedicate myself to crafting innovative and user-friendly applications for the Apple ecosystem.

In addition to developing iOS apps, I am also a strong advocate for open-source contributions. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and I actively contribute to a variety of open-source projects. My technical expertise spans several programming languages and frameworks, including Node.js, Deno, Swift, Go, JavaScript, and TypeScript. By engaging with these communities, I aim to not only enhance my skills but also to give back by helping to improve the tools and resources that developers around the world rely on.

I’m looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as I continue to grow as a developer and community member. If you share a similar interest or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out. Let’s build something amazing together!
